In this exercise, we're going to learn about variables which are one of
the most fundamental concept in most programming languages.

We use variable to temporarily or permenantly store data on the computer
memory.

What is Variable?
A variable is a box which stores the data that user gives. The data
inside a variable is called value. A value inside a variable is not
fixed and which can be changed during the program is running.

In programming, there are two types of a tool that can store the data
that user gives.
- variable -> the value its store is not fixed (as long as the program
runs)
- constant -> the value its store is fixed (as long as the program runs)

In programming, there are ways to write variable in programs.
- camel case : firstName, lastName
- snake case : first_name, last_name
"""

price = 50
print(price) # 50

# the output is 'price', bcoz instead of calling a variable you write
# the variable name in string format.
print('prince')

# Update the value inside a variable
price = 20
print(price) # 20

rating = 4.5
print(rating)

name = 'Alex'

studName = "Aye Chan Nyein"

is_published = True

"""
In python, we can not only these data types - string, char, int, float
& boolean but also we can store complex values like list (array) etc.

What is variable initialisation?
A variable is declared, the computer gives it a location in its memory.
Initially, the location is empty. but when we gives a value to a variable
it stores in a memory.

How to initialize a variable?
In python, we have to give a value to a variable in order to initialize.
Example: 

var-name    assignment operator     value
name        =                       'Alex'
"""

# in here, you will notice that in variable we can various types of data
# type without declaring the data type.
# Bcoz, in python we don't have to declare the data type.
# The python interpreter decide by itself.
