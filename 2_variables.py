"""
In this exercise, we're going to learn about variables which are one of
the most fundamental concept in most programming languages.

We use variable to temporarily or permenantly store data on the computer
memory.

What is Variable?
A variable is a box which stores the data that user gives. The data
inside a variable is called value. A value inside a variable is not
fixed and which can be changed during the program is running.
