# function: builtin.py <- library [print()]
print("Hello World!") # string

# What is 'print()' function?
# It is a function which takes inputs from user, process it and 
# send it back to display (console, webapp, app).

print('A') # char

print(25) # int

print(3.142) # float

print(True) # boolean

# What is Expression?
# Expression is a piece of code that produces a value.
print('*' * 10) # this is an expression


"""
As you know python code is executed line by line.

What is Method, Function & Library?
Both method, function and library are program codes. But
- method(): it is a code that belong to a specific object.
- function(): it is a code that doesn't belong to a specific object.
- library: it is a pre-defined files/codes.

What is Data Types?
A data type is an attribute with a piece of data that tells a computer
how to interpret a value.
Algorithms uses variables to store values.
When an algorithms are converted into programs, the computer needs to be
told what type of data is stored in each variable.

So, every programming language has a number of built-in data types.

There are 5 general types of data types that can be found in most of the
programming languages.

- String -> it will store a set of characters that include spaces, tabs,
alphabets, special characters and even numbers. String is treated as text rather than numbers
because it is a mixture of alphabets, numbers and special characters.

- Character -> it will store a single character one at a time. It is 
similar to 'string' that store spaces, tabs, alphabets, speical characters
and even numbers.

- Integer -> it will only store whole numbers without a fractional/decimal
part.

- Float, Double, Decimal, Real -> it will store a number with a fractional/decimal
part.

- Boolean -> it will only one value at a time from two possible values it
only has.

But in python, we don't have 'character' data type. Python treat the
character data type as a string data type.
